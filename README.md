# Khan Academy SQL Projects
### By: Syeda Dayemi

I've completed the projects while going through the Khan Academy lessons on SQL as a refresher and wanted to put them somewhere safe. I might just split them into different docs based on the sections and include screenshots.

- SQL basics
- More advanced SQL queries
- Relational queries in SQL
- Modifying databases with SQL
